## üïπÔ∏è About the Game

**LumberJack** is a fast-paced Telegram mini-game where players chop a virtual tree by selecting left or right to avoid branches and score as many chops as possible, testing their reflexes.
Play it yourself here: [https://tbot.xyz/lumber/](https://tbot.xyz/lumber/)

## üîß Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/massimilianoviola/chopbot-lumberjack.git
   cd chopbot-lumberjack
   ```
2. **Create & activate a Python environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n chopbot python==3.13 -y
   conda activate chopbot
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Open** `config.ini` and adjust the `[region]` values to match the interesting region in your screen:
   ```ini
   [region]
   top = 417            # Y-offset of capture box
   left = 1145          # X-offset of capture box
   width = 100          # Width of capture box
   height = 600         # Height of capture box
   monitor_number = 0   # Monitor index for multi-monitor setups
   ```
2. **Optional**: tweak delays under `[bot]` so that your PC can keep up and not make mistakes:
   ```ini
   [bot]
   key_delay = 0.008            # Seconds between key taps
   screenshot_delay = 0.1165    # Seconds between screen captures
   ```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Getting your region offsets right is critical. Your region should include all 6 branches in a 600√ó100 window, where each branch starts at the bottom of its 100√ó100 segment (see [here](assets/screen-20250421-220705-529.png)). Use the debug mode (`[debug] enabled = true`) to dump screenshots and fine-tune the box.

## ü™ì Usage

Run ChopBot from the command line:

```bash
python chopbot.py
```

- **Space**: start the bot after the initial countdown
- **Esc**: stop the bot at any time

## üß© Architecture

1. **IOProvider** (`io_provider.py`)
   - Grabs a configured screen region via MSS
   - Extracts only the green channel (2D array) for maximum speed
   - Simulates key presses via Pynput

2. **Move Calculator** (`moves.py`)
   - Splits the screen into 6 horizontal bands
   - Analyze the bottom rows of each band for branch presence
   - Outputs a list of `['left' | 'right']` moves based on the analysis

3. **ChopBot Agent** (`chopbot.py`)
   - Waits for Space or timeout to start
   - Runs the main loop: capture ‚Üí compute ‚Üí act
   - Listens for Esc to terminate
